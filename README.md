# Average Competitive Programming

This is a joke/pun/homage to the awesome series. I will add the `awesome` blogs 
that I usually find on codeforces there.

* [__Efficient and Easy Segment Trees__](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/18051)  
  Contains brilliant analysis and implementation of segment trees.

* [__Geometry: 2D points and lines__](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/48122)  
  Introduction to geometry algorithms + high quality code. Part 1 of a 2 part series.

* [__Geometry: Polygon Algorithms__](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/48868)  
  Implementations of all polygon algorithms.

* [__Heavy Light Decomposition Algorithm__](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/22072)  
  Clean and Efficient Implmenetation of HLD.

* [__A little bit of classics: dynamic programming over subsets and paths in graphs__](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/337)  
  Exactly what the title says.

* [__Z Algorithm__](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/3107)  
  For string algorithms specialists.

* [__Partially Ordered Sets__](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/3781)  
  Mathematical definitions and Dilworth's theorems.

* [__Nim: Algorithmic Game__](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/3657)  
  I think the wiki is better, and contains more variations.

* [__Mo's Algorithm on Trees__](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/43230)  
  Magic on paper. For subtree/path/range queries on trees.

* [__Tutorial on FFT/NTT (part 1)__](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/43499) and [__part 2__](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/48798)  
  Unusually high effort post on codeforces.
  
* [__Dynamic Programming Optimizations__](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/8219)  
  Short and dense content. Knuth, DnC and Convex Hulls.

* [__Incredibly beautiful DP optimization ...__](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/49691)  
  Describes the Knuth DP optimization on a problem. (but applies a second one on top of that).

* [__Staircase Nim__](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/44651)  
  A clever variant of the nim game.

* [__Linear Sieve__](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/54090)  
  Sieve of Erathosthenes concepts.

* [__Invariants and Monovariants__](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/57216)  
  Discussion includes IMO problems.

* [__Top 10 optimizations 2017 - (collectors edition)__](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/53168)  
  The greatest codeforces blog of all time.
