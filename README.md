# Average Competitive Programming

This is a joke/pun/homage to the awesome series. I will add the `awesome` blogs 
that I usually find on codeforces there.


1. [__Efficient and Easy Segment Trees__](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/18051)
  Contains a brilliant analysis and even more brilliant implementation of segment trees.
2. [__Top 10 optimizations 2017 - (collectors edition)__](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/53168)
  The greatest codeforces blog of all time.
