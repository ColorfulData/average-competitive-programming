# Average Competitive Programming

This is a joke/pun/homage to the awesome series. I will add the `awesome` blogs 
that I usually find on codeforces there.

* [__Efficient and Easy Segment Trees__](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/18051)  
  Contains brilliant analysis and implementation of segment trees.

* [__Geometry: 2D points and lines__](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/48122)  
  Introduction to geometry algorithms + high quality code. Part 1 of a 2 part series.

* [__Geometry: Polygon Algorithms__](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/48868)  
  Implementations of all polygon algorithms.

* [__Heavy Light Decomposition Algorithm__](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/22072)  
  Clean and Efficient Implmenetation of HLD.

* [__Top 10 optimizations 2017 - (collectors edition)__](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/53168)  
  The greatest codeforces blog of all time.
